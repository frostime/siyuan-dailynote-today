  part1:
  - '#### Note: Duplicate daily notes detected'
  - Conflict files are listed below, the last line, indicated in bold, represents
    the earliest dailynote and will be treated as the main dailynote for auto-handeling
  - '| Document ID | Title | Created | Updated | Notebook |'

  part2:
  - '- **Why does this happen?**'
  - '    You may have created a daily note on another device before and then created
    a daily note on this device, resulting in a synchronization conflict.'
  - '- **How to solve it manually?**'
  - '    Please merge and delete redundant diaries manually: Open today''s daily note,
    locate the daily note document, and the conflicting document will be nearby.'
  - '- **What do the following buttons mean?**'
  - '    Auto-handeling method, please refer to the plugin documentation for details.'
  part3:
  - '<p style="color: red">'
  - We found that in addition to the dailynote document conflict, the parent document
    at the upper level seems to be in conflict as well, the "Auto Handler" <b>cannot
    handle this complexity of merging document trees</b>.
  - </p>
  - '<p style="color: red">'
  - <u>You can still to use the "Auto Handler" feature</u>, while it is <b>recommended</b>
    that you <b>manually deal with duplicate parent documents</b> after auto-handling.
