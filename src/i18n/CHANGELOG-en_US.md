### Daily Note Today v1.2.0

- Interface style of the settings page has been revamped

    As the plugin's functionality gradually becomes more complex, the settings page has become more cluttered. In this update, we have redesigned the settings page to make it look more organized.

- Improved diary conflict detection feature

    1. Added an "Auto Merge" button, which automatically combines all conflicting diaries into one page, avoiding the hassle of manual handling.
    2. Added a new setting to disable the "Auto Open Diary" feature on mobile devices, preventing diary conflicts on mobile devices.
