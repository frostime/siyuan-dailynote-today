### Daily Note Today v1.1.5 Update

Details can be found in [Milestone V1.1.5](https://github.com/frostime/siyuan-dailynote-today/milestone/16)

This update has improved the reservation window:

1. Fixed a bug where the reservation panel was not displayed properly when there were no reservations.
2. Use the openTab API to open blocks, which is smoother.
3. New feature: Click the counter number next to the reservation panel date to view all reservation blocks in the floating window.
