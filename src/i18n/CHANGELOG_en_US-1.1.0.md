## Daoly Note Today v1.1.0 Update Notes

### New Feature: Reserve This Block

Introducing the new feature in this version: the ability to reserve blocks. You can think of it as a simple TODO function.

- Reserve This Block: Select a block and click on "Reserve" menu. If the block's content includes future dates, the block will be added to the reserve list.
- Automatic Insertion: On the day corresponding to the reserved date, the plug-in will automatically embed all reserved blocks for that day into the diary when creating today's notes.

> If you have a better name for this feature, please feel free to open an issue.

### Other Updates

- Bug Fix: Changed the notification when the default notebook cannot be found
    - Previously, an error message would pop up, which could cause unnecessary panic due to unclear information
    - After the update, a dialog box will appear, providing a full description of the error.
