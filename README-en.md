## Introduction

1. When the plugin is launched, today's note is automatically created/opened.
    - Automatically open today's note in the notebook ranked first. If it doesn't exist, create and open it automatically.
    - Ignore "SiYuan User Guide".

2. The dropdown menu in the upper right corner provides options for quickly creating/opening today's note.
    - The dropdown menu lists all notebooks in order.
    - "SiYuan User Guide".
    - Click on a notebook to automatically open/create today's note.

3. The dropdown menu provides a flag indicating whether today's note has already been created for each notebook.
    - If there is a "√" flag before a notebook option, it means that note has already been created for that notebook.

4. When there is an update to a notebook (such as opening/closing/creating/moving a notebook), press the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+alt+u" to update the status.
    - The plugin can automatically track the creation status of the note, but it will not track the status of the notebooks.
    - Therefore, when opening, closing, creating, or moving a notebook, press the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+alt+u" to update the status.

5. Settings panel
    - You can choose in the settings panel whether to automatically open today's note when the plugin is enabled.
